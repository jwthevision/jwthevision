- 👋 Hi, I’m @jwthevision!
I'm an audio professional by trade but lover of all things tech!

🔉 While my background is mostly based in music and audio, my time as an audio engineer prepared me
for professional pursuits in as many disciplines as I can imagine.

I'm interested in:
Audio and its many wonders,
Audio over I/P,
Interopeability,
Virtual Machines,
Programming in Python, C++ and JavaScript,
Librosa,
Software Defined Radio,
Digital Signal Processing,
Cloud Based Computing,
Pro Tools,
Logic Pro X,
Ableton Live,

📚 📚 📚
I graduated from Full Sail University in 2013, earning m Bachelor's of Science in Music Production.

I then ventured deeper into the business/administrative side of music,
I attended The Unversity of Miami's Frost School of Music's 'Frost Online" platoform,
earning my Master of Music in Music Business and Entertainment Industries.
