- 👋 Hi, I’m @jwthevision! You can also call me Jerald!
My previous profession and focus was audio, mixing and mastering. It is finally time to turn over a new leaf.

I'm a lover of all things tech and my time as an audio engineer has piqued my interest in all forms of problem solving.
Like with most engineering roles, my role as audio engineer has involved several different forms of tech support, troubleshooting
and file management just to name a few.

📚 📚 📚
I graduated from Full Sail University in 2013, earning my Bachelor's of Science in Music Production.

I then ventured deeper into the business/administrative side of music,
I attended The Unversity of Miami's Frost School of Music's 'Frost Online" platoform,
earning my Master of Music in Music Business and Entertainment Industries.

I am interested in exploring:
Web development (I've loved website creation since I was editing myspace pages in the old days)
Software development
Creating things that make life easier for tech savvy creatives
exploring how my love for programming can be meshed with my love for audio

Going to leverage my 10+ years as a professional audio engineer to grow into a new career!

I've spent the last year and a half learning multiple programming languages:
Python
Java
Html
Css
Js
More soon to come

I'm currently dedicating my time to comleteing The Odin Project's coursework!

🎸
I am also a guitarist, absolutely love to paint and I'm a gamer through and through!
