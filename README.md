- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jwthevision!
I'm an audio professional by trade but lover of all things tech!

While my background is mostly based in music and audio, my time as an audio engineer prepared me
for professional pursuits in as many disciplines as I can imagine.

I'm interested in:
Audio over I/P,
Interopeability,
Virtual Machines,
Programming in Python, C++ and JavaScript,
Librosa,
Software Defined Radio,
Digital Signal Processing,
Cloud Based Computing,
